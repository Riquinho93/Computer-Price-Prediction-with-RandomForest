Computer price predition with Random Forest deploying using FLASK and HEROKU

A Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm used in modeling predictions and behavior analysis. Random Forest is constructed from decision tree algorithms.

The decision tree builds classification or regression models in the form of a tree structure.
